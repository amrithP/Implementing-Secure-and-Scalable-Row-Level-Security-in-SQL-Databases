Implementing Secure and Scalable Row-Level Security in SQL Databases
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Row-Level Security (RLS) in SQL databases to enforce fine-grained access control based on user roles. It covers various techniques to restrict data visibility while ensuring performance, security, and compliance.

Features
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Users can only access data they are authorized to view.
Policy-Based Security: Implementation of security policies to filter data dynamically.
Multi-Tenant Data Isolation: Secure handling of data across multiple users or organizations.
Performance Optimization: Efficient query execution while maintaining security.
Integration with Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Fabric: Applying RLS for Power BI and enterprise environments.
Technologies Used
SQL Server 2016+ (or Azure SQL Database)
Microsoft Fabric (for Power BI integration)
T-SQL (Transact-SQL) Security Policies
Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
SQL Server 2016 or later (or Azure SQL Database)
Microsoft Fabric account (if implementing RLS for Power BI)
Steps to Set Up RLS
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/row-level-security-sql.git
cd row-level-security-sql
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio.
Execute the SQL scripts from row-level-security.sql in your database.
Create users and roles as per the provided examples.
Test security policies by running queries as different users.
Usage
Modify the SQL scripts to define custom security policies.
Assign users to appropriate roles and verify restricted data access.
If using Microsoft Fabric, apply RLS filters in Power BI to enforce data security.
Example: Creating a Security Policy
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE SECURITY POLICY UserAccessPolicy
ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.UserAccessPredicate(UserID)  
ON dbo.SensitiveData
WITH (STATE = ON);
